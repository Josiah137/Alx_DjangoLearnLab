## this is a continuation from what i had been doing prviously worrking on week 12 Library system project in my trial dir 

# this is a read me where i used it to practice the things that i felt i have not covered they yet like actual token autentication by settting diffrent auttication classes and permissions like (is admin, is authticated, custom permissions like that of isAuther or isOwner)
